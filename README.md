### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cindy
<samp>

- ðŸ‘¯ Welcome to my github playground. I'm a data wizard with a knack for turning raw data into fascinating solutions. If you're looking to collaborate with me on a project or need some assistance with data-related work, feel free to check out my Upwork account [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01970fb43b70675c6b).

- ðŸ“« You can reach me through my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cindybtari/) profile or my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cindyangelira_) or send me an [Email](cindybtari@gmail.com)! You can also find some of my articles on Medium, where I cover topics related to data science and machine learning [Medium](https://medium.com/@cindybtari). 

- âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not knee-deep in data, I'm curating my wardrobe and watching cats and huskies' videos. I also read a lot of mangas/manhwas/manhuas and my favorite character is Sung Jin Woo. ðŸŽ®ðŸ•¹

Let's become a monarch and drop me a line if you are interested in teaming up!
